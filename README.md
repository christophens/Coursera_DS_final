This repository contains all code related final assignments for the Coursera Applied Data Science course capstone project.

The project is split into two notebooks, contained in the notebookds folder.

- Introduction_data_collecting.ipynb contains the introduction and all code related to the data collecting task. Running this notebook requires foursquare api credentials as well as a key for the api of the American Community Census.
	
- Exploration_modelling_evaluation.ipynb contains all code related to data exploration, modeling and all evaluation tasks.


You can run the second notebook without any api credentials. The ny_acs, ny_acs_b and ny_df2 csv files contain all the data that is used in Exploration_modelling_evaluation.ipynb.
